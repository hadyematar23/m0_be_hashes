# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

The syntax assignment -- I'm not sure exactly what is wrong or what could be improved. I thought there may have been something with the colons vs. hash rockets, but I'm still struggling with understanding the differences and how I can use them to call for the keys or the values. 

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

It's okay. I have a notebook and a pen but I don't use it too much to be honest. I've mainly used it only to diagram stuff or to be able to label stuff when I'm trying to learn the vocab. 

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

Running the code for sure. Google has been helpful too but trying to run the code based on my intuition of how stuff works is my go-to.
